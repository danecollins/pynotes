# Notes and reminders for Python

This is a collection of examples and explanations on new libraries that
I found interesting but often have no imediate need for. The examples
allow me to make sure I understand the functionality and provide samples
for when I need them.

Many of the examples are flushed out in jupyter notebooks because that
provides a natural way to annotate the code.  Some examples are in pure
python files, especially when the example is best run from the command
line.

All examples are created for python 3 but most should work in legacy python
by some includes from the \_\_future\_\_ module such as print\_function.
